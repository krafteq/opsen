# @opsen/docker

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 2fa5204: Fix CI build failures and resolve Dependabot security alerts. Add `src` to package `files` field for correct pnpm `file:` dependency resolution during clean builds. Pin TypeScript to 5.8.x and unify `@pulumi/pulumi` version to avoid type mismatches. Update `@eslint/json`, `@eslint/markdown`, and add pnpm overrides for `flatted` and `minimatch` vulnerabilities.
- bc630fd: Fix published packages being unusable from npm. Replace `file:` inter-workspace references with pnpm `workspace:^` protocol so dependencies resolve to proper version ranges when published. Add `prepack` script to cert-renewer to ensure `azure-function.zip` is included in the tarball. Add `go/out` to agent `files` array to override `.gitignore` and include the compiled Go binary.
- Updated dependencies [2fa5204]
  - @opsen/platform@0.2.1

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- a8cb2c7: Move runtime-specific types from @opsen/platform to their respective packages (AzureRuntime → @opsen/azure, DockerRuntime → @opsen/docker, KubernetesRuntime → @opsen/k8s). Platform is now standalone with no knowledge of specific runtimes. Also replace `import * as azure from '@pulumi/azure-native'` with targeted submodule imports across all Azure files.
